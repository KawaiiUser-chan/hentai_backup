# Contributing

Please note that this project assumes that you have python `v3.8+`
installed. Even though this project deals with NSFW content, we want
to keep all talk on GitHub topic related and appropriate for work with
software development.

## Getting Started 

If you want to to work on a new feature or fix an existing one, 
create a new topic branch denoted by `dev-*`. In case of the former
one it is recommended to create an new issue first. Make sure that
you pass all unit tests before making a pull requests, and write a
new test if your feature isn't already covered by one of the other 
tests. Generally speaking, this project doesn't really need any
external dependencies other than the `requests` module, so if you want
to introduce new dependencies into your work discuss these changes 
in your commit message so that it is clear why this would be necessary.

## Addiotional Sources

You may find it useful to browse through code of similar repositories.
Documentation for this code base is also on my bucket list and will be added
soon.
